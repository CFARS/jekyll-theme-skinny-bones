The purpose of the Consortium For the Advancement of Remote Sensing is to reduce cost of wind energy by better de-risking wind energy projects of new generation (higher hub heights, larger rotors). The consortium will act as a federated industry facilitator supporting acceptance of Remote Sensing (RS) during "pre-construction" wind resource assessment phases. This will be achieved by joining members' resources in order to support the different groups working towards broader acceptance and standardization of the use of Remote Sensing (IEC, IEA or others). The consortium may also initiate some targeted projects in collaboration with independent parties to address pressing questions regarding the use of Remote Sensing. Compelling results will be communication to various stakeholders in the wind energy value chain: technology providers, developers, operators, independent engineers, banks and other financial stakeholders.

## Mission
- Increase acceptance of Remote Sensing Device (RSD) by sharing information and involving the broad industry
- Reduce project development costs by supporting/enabling standardization and acceptance of RSD
- Reduce uncertainty of pre-construction estimates by demonstrating and leveraging the value of RSD

## Vision
- Significantly contribute to the competitiveness of the wind industry by 2021 through broader acceptance/validation of RSD

## Working Groups

![Science Subgroup](https://cfars.github.io/images/subgroups_science.png)
- Science Subgroup lead: Alexandra St.PÃ© (RWE)
    - Empower the wind energy industry to achieve data-driven answers to persistent RSD use hurdles
    - Leverage open source science and tools to build consensus and establish Best Practice Frameworks for Stakeholder collaboration 

- *Flow Correction - Scott Wylie (ZX)*
    - Provide data-driven validation of methods used to correct RSD measurements in Complex Flow. 
    - Demonstrate typical flow curvature bias based on terrain complexity and roughness, and create a standardized correction methods. 

- *Site Suitability - Alexandra Arnsten (NRG)*
    - Develop tools and standard methodologies for correcting RSD Turbulence Intensity biases when compared to anemometers and RSD's. 

- *Power Curve Correction - Peter Stuart (RES)*
    - Formerly the Power Curve Working Group
    - Improve the modeling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions.

- *Power Curve Testing - Dan Bernadett (UL)*

![Guidance Subgroup](https://cfars.github.io/images/subgroups_guidance.png)
- Guidance Subgroup Lead: Andrew Black (Vaisala)
    - Socialize existing Standards and Best Practices to the broad industry: investors, IEs, OEMs, and developers
    - Clearly identify areas of improvement for acceptance of RSD via surveys and outreach
    - Recommend areas for improvements RSD method improvement to Science Working Groups
    - Amplify findings from Science Group via open-source documents and publications; drive consensus on new Best Practices
