- Science Subgroup lead: [Alexandra St.PÃ© (RWE)](alexandra.st.pe@rwe.com)
- Empower the wind energy industry to achieve data-driven answers to persistent RSD use hurdles
- Leverage open source science and tools to build consensus and establish Best Practice Frameworks for Stakeholder collaboration 

## *Flow Correction*
- Leader: [Scott Wylie (ZX)](scott.wylie@zxlidars.com)
- Provide data-driven validation of methods used to correct RSD measurements in Complex Flow
- Demonstrate typical flow curvature bias based on terrain complexity and roughness, and create a standardized correction methods

## *Site Suitability*
- Leader: [Alexandra Arnsten (NRG)](aea@nrgsystems.com)
- Develop tools and standard methodologies for correcting RSD Turbulence Intensity biases when compared to anemometers and RSD's

## *Power Curve Correction*
- Leader: [Peter Stuart (RES)](peter.stuart@res-group.com)
- Formerly the Power Curve Working Group
- Improve the modeling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions

## *Power Performance Testing*
- Leader: [Dan Bernadett (UL)](daniel.bernadett@ul.com)
- Develop Best Practices for Power Performance Testing following the IEC 61400-12-1 and beyond


## __Guidance Subgroup__
![Guidance Subgroup](https://cfars.github.io/images/subgroups_guidance.png)
- Guidance Subgroup Lead: [Andrew Black (Vaisala)](andrew.hastingsblack@vaisala.com)
- Socialize existing Standards and Best Practices to the broad industry: investors, IEs, OEMs, and developers
- Clearly identify areas of improvement for acceptance of RSD via surveys and outreach
- Recommend areas for improvements RSD method improvement to Science Working Groups
- Amplify findings from Science Group via open-source documents and publications; drive consensus on new Best Practices
