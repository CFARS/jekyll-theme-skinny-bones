## __Science Subgroup__
![Science Subgroup](https://cfars.github.io/images/subgroups_science.png)
- Science Subgroup lead: Alexandra St.PÃ© (RWE)
- Empower the wind energy industry to achieve data-driven answers to persistent RSD use hurdles
- Leverage open source science and tools to build consensus and establish Best Practice Frameworks for Stakeholder collaboration 

## *Flow Correction - Scott Wylie (ZX)*
- Provide data-driven validation of methods used to correct RSD measurements in Complex Flow. 
- Demonstrate typical flow curvature bias based on terrain complexity and roughness, and create a standardized correction methods. 

## *Site Suitability - Alexandra Arnsten (NRG)*
- Develop tools and standard methodologies for correcting RSD Turbulence Intensity biases when compared to anemometers and RSD's. 

## *Power Curve Correction - Peter Stuart (RES)*
- Formerly the Power Curve Working Group
- Improve the modeling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions.

## *Power Curve Testing - Dan Bernadett (UL)*

## __Guidance Subgroup__

- Guidance Subgroup Lead: Andrew Black (Vaisala)
- Socialize existing Standards and Best Practices to the broad industry: investors, IEs, OEMs, and developers
- Clearly identify areas of improvement for acceptance of RSD via surveys and outreach
- Recommend areas for improvements RSD method improvement to Science Working Groups
- Amplify findings from Science Group via open-source documents and publications; drive consensus on new Best Practices
