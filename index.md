The Consortium for Advancing Remote Sensing is a broad wind energy industry consortium on a mission to accelerate adoption of remote sensing devices (lidar and sodar) for wind energy applications.  

__Remote sensors are a disruptive technology, with the potential to (1) increase the speed and safety of wind energy development by elimination of meteorological masts, and (2) decrease uncertainties through full use of rich remote sensor datasets covering the entire rotor layer.__

This website is a clearinghouse of the latest developments in international standards, scientific research, best practices, and other relevant topics to industrial usage of lidar for wind energy development and operations.
